## Short answer

- **If** superficial vein thrombosis involves an axial lower‑limb superficial vein segment ≥ 5 cm **or** lies 3–5 cm from a deep‑vein junction **and** no additional venous thrombo‑embolism risk factors are present
  - **Then** start _prophylactic‑dose_ anticoagulation for 45 days:
    - fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily [1](id_xxx)
    - **or** low‑molecular‑weight heparin (dalteparin 5 000 IU subcutaneously every 12 h _or_ enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily)
    - **or** rivaroxaban 10 mg orally once daily
- **If** pain, oedema or erythema persist, also apply class II compression stocking, limb elevation, and cool or warm compresses (avoid non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs once anticoagulation begins).
- **If** thrombus propagates (< 3 cm from deep system) **or** patient carries medical venous thrombo‑embolism risk factors, **then** switch to full‑dose therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 months.

## Contextual answer

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology

- Superficial vein thrombosis of axial veins is more frequent than deep‑vein thrombosis and carries an early risk of deep‑vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
- Risk rises when thrombus is ≥ 5 cm or approaches the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junctions.[2](id_yyy)

### Clinical risk stratification for venous thrombo‑embolism

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                  | Immediate thrombo‑embolism risk | Initial treatment                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low              | Axial segment ≤ 5 cm and > 5 cm from deep system                                                                                                                          | Low                             | Supportive care only                      |
| **Intermediate** | Axial segment ≥ 5 cm **or** 3–5 cm from deep system, no additional medical risk factors [1](id_xxx)                                                                       | **Moderate**                    | Prophylactic‑dose anticoagulation 45 days |
| High             | Thrombus < 3 cm from deep system, propagation despite prophylaxis, recurrence, or concomitant medical risk factors (previous deep‑vein thrombosis, thrombophilia, cancer) | High                            | Therapeutic‑dose anticoagulation 3 months |
