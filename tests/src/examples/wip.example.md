### Diagnostic algorithm (decision‑tree)

- **Suspected superficial vein thrombosis** → duplex ultrasound of superficial and deep systems
  - **If** axial superficial vein thrombosis confirmed
    - measure length and distance from junctions[2](id_yyy)
    - assign risk category as above
  - **If** tributary‑only thrombosis → supportive care, follow‑up ultrasound if symptoms progress.

### Treatment of intermediate‑risk superficial vein thrombosis

**Exact schemes**[2](id_yyy)

| Drug         | Dose                      | Route        | Frequency      | Duration |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- |
| Fondaparinux | 2.5 mg                    | Subcutaneous | Once daily     | 45 days  |
| Dalteparin   | 5 000 international units | Subcutaneous | Every 12 hours | 45 days  |
| Enoxaparin   | 40 mg                     | Subcutaneous | Once daily     | 45 days  |
| Rivaroxaban  | 10 mg                     | Oral         | Once daily     | 45 days  |

**Supportive measures**

- Class II or higher graduated compression stocking covering thrombosed segment.[1](id_xxx)
- Limb elevation to waist level.
- Cool or warm compresses as tolerated.
- Avoid non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs once anticoagulation is started to limit bleeding risk.[2](id_yyy)

### Follow‑up

- Reassess clinically at 7–10 days; repeat duplex ultrasound if pain, erythema or cord length increase.
- At day 45 obtain D‑dimer; persistent elevation suggests residual thrombus and may justify extended prophylaxis.

### Prognosis

- With the above regimen the incidence of thrombo‑embolic complications at 47 days falls from ≈ 6 % to < 1 %.
- Recurrence risk rises if anticoagulation is stopped early; full 45‑day course is therefore recommended.
