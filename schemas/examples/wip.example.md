# How to treat a superficial vein thrombosis of the lower extremity veins if the patient has intermediate risk of VTE ?

## short_answer

- **If** superficial vein thrombosis involves an axial lower‑limb superficial vein segment ≥ 5 cm **or** lies 3–5 cm from a deep‑vein junction **and** no additional venous thrombo‑embolism risk factors are present
  - **Then** start _prophylactic‑dose_ anticoagulation for 45 days:
    - fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily
    - **or** low‑molecular‑weight heparin (dalteparin 5 000 IU subcutaneously every 12 h _or_ enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily)
    - **or** rivaroxaban 10 mg orally once daily
- **If** pain, oedema or erythema persist, also apply class II compression stocking, limb elevation, and cool or warm compresses (avoid non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs once anticoagulation begins).
- **If** thrombus propagates (< 3 cm from deep system) **or** patient carries medical venous thrombo‑embolism risk factors, **then** switch to full‑dose therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 months.

### 1 Epidemiology and pathophysiology

- Superficial vein thrombosis of axial veins is more frequent than deep‑vein thrombosis and carries an early risk of deep‑vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
- Risk rises when thrombus is ≥ 5 cm or approaches the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junctions.

### 2 Clinical risk stratification for venous thrombo‑embolism

| Category         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                  | Immediate thrombo‑embolism risk | Initial treatment                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low              | Axial segment ≤ 5 cm and > 5 cm from deep system                                                                                                                          | Low                             | Supportive care only                      |
| **Intermediate** | Axial segment ≥ 5 cm **or** 3–5 cm from deep system, no additional medical risk factors                                                                                   | **Moderate**                    | Prophylactic‑dose anticoagulation 45 days |
| High             | Thrombus < 3 cm from deep system, propagation despite prophylaxis, recurrence, or concomitant medical risk factors (previous deep‑vein thrombosis, thrombophilia, cancer) | High                            | Therapeutic‑dose anticoagulation 3 months |

### 3 Diagnostic algorithm (decision‑tree)

- **Suspected superficial vein thrombosis** → duplex ultrasound of superficial and deep systems
  - **If** axial superficial vein thrombosis confirmed
    - measure length and distance from junctions
    - assign risk category as above
  - **If** tributary‑only thrombosis → supportive care, follow‑up ultrasound if symptoms progress.

### 4 Treatment of intermediate‑risk superficial vein thrombosis

**Exact schemes**

| Drug         | Dose                      | Route        | Frequency      | Duration |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- |
| Fondaparinux | 2.5 mg                    | Subcutaneous | Once daily     | 45 days  |
| Dalteparin   | 5 000 international units | Subcutaneous | Every 12 hours | 45 days  |
| Enoxaparin   | 40 mg                     | Subcutaneous | Once daily     | 45 days  |
| Rivaroxaban  | 10 mg                     | Oral         | Once daily     | 45 days  |

**Supportive measures**

- Class II or higher graduated compression stocking covering thrombosed segment.
- Limb elevation to waist level.
- Cool or warm compresses as tolerated.
- Avoid non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs once anticoagulation is started to limit bleeding risk.

### 5 Follow‑up

- Reassess clinically at 7–10 days; repeat duplex ultrasound if pain, erythema or cord length increase.
- At day 45 obtain D‑dimer; persistent elevation suggests residual thrombus and may justify extended prophylaxis.

### 6 Prognosis

- With the above regimen the incidence of thrombo‑embolic complications at 47 days falls from ≈ 6 % to < 1 %.
- Recurrence risk rises if anticoagulation is stopped early; full 45‑day course is therefore recommended.
